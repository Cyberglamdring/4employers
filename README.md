About Me

Experience
-
In my first serious IT job I worked as a system administrator for three years. When I learned a lot in this area, I decided that I want to improve my skills. Three months ago, I'm passed interview on DevOps lab. As result, I improved my skills and interest in DevOps area.

Achievements
-
In my opinion, now is my best achievement: At first, I created Kubernetes cluster with master and workers pods. Secondly, provision Jenkins artifacts on kube cluster and stored artifacts on Nexus local repository (which was created on another VM). Also, I created container on worked pod with SonarQube for continuous inspection of code quality. Perhaps, do not forget about performance analyzing. I used for this needs Zabbix or Prometeus. To sum up, I think, I can create Ansible playbook for this provision.

Goals
-
My first goal is to gain professional skills in DevOps and improve them. Also I want to improve my English. Secondly I want to get a senior position. Finally I want to make career in DevOps area as a useful specialist.

Hobbies
-
Let me tell about my hobbies:
1.	Reading. I like historical, fantasy and fantastic novels. I'm crazy about Tolkien and Strugatsky brothers. The last book what I read is Richard Morgan's "Altered Carbon" about Takeshi Kovacs. This book is a cyberpunk-detective novel. Set in a future in which interstellar travel is facilitated by transferring mind between bodies.
2.	Historical reconstruction. I'm in love with Middle Ages weapons, castles and whatever
3.	Game development. Design of levels and develop role-play content. It means I write text quests and create characters. It my small project, maybe it will grow someday
