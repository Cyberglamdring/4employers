About Me
=
Experience
-
I started on the system administrator side, then went over to Systems Engineer. Prior to EPAM I worked with virtualization tools, Windows/Linux servers, also supported people in the organization. 
I created several Linux servers on VMware: Zabbix on Ubuntu, a simple XMPP organization chat server with Open Fire on Debian and a firewall/router/load balancer server with PfSense on FreeBSD.
I helped peoples in the organization with technical problems. Also, I analyzed and solve problems with servers/networking/database and windows applications.
As a result, I was good at virtualization tools, troubleshooting, logging and solving technical problems.


When I first joined EPAM, I passed to the DevOps lab and graduated it of 3 months. I learn a lot of Cloud, CI/CD tools and concept, git, containerization, configuration management tools, virtualization, monitoring tools, programming languages, build tools and software development methodologies.

Achievements
-
In my opinion, now is my best achievement: At first, I created Kubernetes cluster with master and workers pods. Secondly, provision Jenkins artifacts on kube cluster and stored artifacts (which build using Maven tool) on Nexus local repository (which I was created on another VM). Also, I created container on Worker POD with SonarQube for continuous inspection of code quality. Perhaps, do not forget about performance analyzing. I used for this needs Zabbix or Prometeus. To sum up, I think, I can create Ansible playbook for this provision.

Goals
-
My first goal is to gain professional skills in DevOps and improve them. Also, I want to improve my English. Secondly, I want to get a senior position. Finally, I want to make career in DevOps area as a useful specialist.

Hobbies 
-
Let me tell about my hobbies:
1.	Reading. I like historical, fantasy and fantastic novels. I'm crazy about Tolkien and Strugatsky brothers. The last book what I read is Richard Morgan's "Altered Carbon" about Takeshi Kovacs. This book is a cyberpunk-detective novel. Set in a future in which interstellar travel is facilitated by transferring mind between bodies.
2.	Historical reconstruction. I'm in love with Middle Ages weapons, castles and whatever
3.	Game development. Design of levels and develop role-play content. It means I write text quests and create characters. It my small project, maybe it will grow someday
